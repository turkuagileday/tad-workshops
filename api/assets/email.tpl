Hi,

We are so delighted to see you have chosen to participate in our day of
workshops on Monday the 12th of May! To aid the preparations and to spread
everyone as evenly as possible among the exciting possibilities available we
would like to hear in advance which workshops you plan to attend to.

You can claim your seat in the workshops of your preference by follow this
personal link: [LINK]

Each workshop has a limit for the number of participants so the earlier you
make the choice the more certain it is there are still seats available.

The workshop registration closes on Friday 9th of May at 2.00 pm. Those who
decide not to pre-register are left to choose on the day among the workshops
with seats left available.

Best regards,
Turku Agile Group
